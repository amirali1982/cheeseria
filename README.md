### Technical Issues

With some React 18+ syntax we need to use React Router 6+ otherwise there may be some compatibility issues. However, for this small project React Router 5.3.0 was enough.

### Future Improvements

- Upgrade React Router to 6+
- Add multiple image support. (Architectural change)
- UI Improvements to make it more modern.
- SEO Optimize the Cheeseria
- Add pagination or lazy load to the UI.
- Add Cypress e2e test suites.
- Add authentication like Okta.
